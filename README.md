# dotfiles

This repository contains dotfiles for various editors.

In the case of the emacs dotfile, an example of a directory local configuration file (.dir-local.el)
is also provided. When such a file is located in a sub-directory from which emacs is loaded, it is
used to overwrite default dotfile parameters.

### References

Much of the inspiration for the spacemacs dot file came from
[TheBB](https://github.com/TheBB/spacemacs-layers). He also has a great series of spacemacs tutorial
videos on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/evfonn/videos?disable_polymer=1).
